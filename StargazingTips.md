Tips for Stargazing:

1. Choose a clear, (mostly) moon-less night to go out and find a location away from city lights.
2. Plan out your observations before heading out. This helps you to prepare any special equipment you may need and also avoids the issue of having to look up something on your device once you’re out in the dark. (You can use Clear Skies to help plan your next adventure! :) )
3. Allow your eyes to become fully dark-adapted once you’re on-site. Plan to allow at least 30mins for this and try to avoid looking at any bright lights (phones, flashlights, full moon, etc.), as even a quick glance can break your dark adaptation and you’ll have to restart.
4. Use “Averted Vision”, meaning looking slightly to the side of the object you’re observing. This uses your peripheral vision and helps you detect faint objects that are invisible when you stare directly at them.
5. Pack a blanket, sweater, water, snacks, and a flashlight (just in case) and most importantly, HAVE FUN!

Bonus: Remember, you don’t need any fancy equipment to have fun star-gazing and enjoying the awesomeness of our night skies. There is so much available to observe with just our human eye.

Clear Skies!
